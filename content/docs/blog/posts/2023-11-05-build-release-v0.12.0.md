Shipwright is back with the v0.12.0 release, moving our API from _alpha_ to _beta_.

Some key points to consider:

- Starting with the _v0.12.0_ release, a conversion webhook is deployed to provide support for both _v1alpha1_ and _v1beta1_ API versions.
- Users are encouraged to adopt the _v1beta1_ API.
- Support for _v1alpha1_ will continue for some additional releases. Part of the _v1alpha1_ API is already deprecated and not available in _v1beta1_.


Please take a look at the following blog [post](https://shipwright.io/blog/2023/11/07/introducing-shipwright-beta-api/) to see some of our guidelines on moving your Shipwright Custom Resources from _alpha_ to _beta_.
