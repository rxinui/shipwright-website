Shipwright Build v0.4.0 can be found on GitHub at [shipwright-io/build v0.4.0](https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/releases/tag/v0.4.0).

This release includes several breaking changes and is incompatible with previous versions of Shipwright Build.

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Install v0.4.0 using the release YAML manifest:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/releases/download/v0.4.0/release.yaml
   ```

2. Download existing `Build`, `BuildStrategy`, and `ClusterBuildStrategy` objects from your cluster in YAML format.
3. For each object, change the `apiVersion` from `build.dev/v1alpha1` to `shipwright.io/v1alpha1`.
   Remove any identifiers and creation timestamps from the object's metadata.
4. Run `kubectl apply -f` against each manifest to re-create the relevant object.

## Uninstalling v0.3.0

Once the desired Shipwright Build objects have been migrated to the new api group, you can remove v0.3.0 from your cluster:

1. Delete the `build-operator` namespace:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl delete ns build-operator
   ```

2. (optional) Delete all `BuildRun`, `Build`, `BuildStrategy`, and `ClusterBuildStrategy` objects in the build.dev api group on the cluster:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl delete buildrun.build.dev --all --all-namespaces
   $ kubectl delete build.build.dev --all --all-namespaces
   $ kubectl delete buildstrategy.build.dev --all --all-namespaces
   $ kubectl delete clusterbuildstrategy.build.dev --all
   ```

3. (optional) Delete the custom resource definitions for `BuildRun`, `Build`, `BuildStrategy`, and `ClusterBuildStrategy` in the build.dev api group:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl delete crd buildruns.build.dev
   $ kubectl delete crd builds.build.dev
   $ kubectl delete crd buildstrategies.build.dev
   $ kubectl delete crd clusterbuildstrategies.build.dev
   ```
