Shipwright Build v0.6.0 can be found on GitHub at [shipwright-io/build v0.6.0](https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/releases/tag/v0.6.0).

This release includes a breaking change to Builds: runtime images are not anymore supported. We encourage the use of [multi-stage Dockerfiles instead](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/).

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Install v0.6.0 using the release YAML manifest:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/releases/download/v0.6.0/release.yaml
   ```

2. (Optionally) Install the sample build strategies using the YAML manifest:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/releases/download/v0.6.0/sample-strategies.yaml
   ```
