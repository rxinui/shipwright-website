Shipwright Build v0.11.0 can be found on GitHub at [shipwright-io/build v0.11.0](https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/releases/tag/v0.11.0). The CLI is available at [shipwright-io/cli v0.11.0](https://github.com/shipwright-io/cli/releases/tag/v0.11.0).

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Install v0.11.0 using the release YAML manifest:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/releases/download/v0.11.0/release.yaml
   ```

2. (Optionally) Install the sample build strategies using the YAML manifest:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/releases/download/v0.11.0/sample-strategies.yaml
   ```

### Deprecations

Shipwright Build v0.11.0 comes with a set of deprecations in our custom resources:

* In Builds, `spec.sources` is deprecated. We will consolidate supporting a single source for a Build under `spec.source`. Also, HTTP sources are deprecated because we think that the focus that secure software supply chain brings, does not match with artifacts that are loaded from an HTTP endpoint.
* In Builds, `spec.dockerfile` and `spec.builder` are deprecated. Those fields were introduced at the very beginning of this project to support relevant build strategies. But, those fields only relate to specific build strategies. Since a couple of releases, we support [strategy parameters](https://shipwright.io/docs/build/buildstrategies/#strategy-parameters) for that purpose where we will move to.
* In BuildRuns, `spec.serviceAccount.generate` is deprecated. We think that the adhoc generation of service accounts does not fit very well in Kubernetes' security principals and will therefore move away from that concept.
