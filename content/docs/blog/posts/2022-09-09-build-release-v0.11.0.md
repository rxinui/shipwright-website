Shipwright is back with the v0.11.0 release. It is mostly a maintenance release without new features:

* We updated dependencies to mitigate security vulnerabilities.
* We updated our images to be based on the new Red Hat Universal Base Image 9 Minimal.
* We updated build strategy tools as usual. This includes a fix that re-enabled the ko build strategy. Congratulations to them for moving into the own organization. It is a great build tool that we do not just provide a sample for, but also use in our own builds.

Behind the scenes we are working on streamlining our API objects. As a first step, we deprecate the following fields:

* In Builds, `spec.sources` is deprecated. We will consolidate supporting a single source for a Build under `spec.source`. Also, HTTP sources are deprecated because we think that the focus that secure software supply chain brings, does not match with artifacts that are loaded from an HTTP endpoint.
* In Builds, `spec.dockerfile` and `spec.builder` are deprecated. Those fields were introduced at the very beginning of this project to support relevant build strategies. But, those fields only relate to specific build strategies. Since a couple of releases, we support [strategy parameters](https://shipwright.io/docs/build/buildstrategies/#strategy-parameters) for that purpose where we will move to.
* In BuildRuns, `spec.serviceAccount.generate` is deprecated. We think that the adhoc generation of service accounts does not fit very well in Kubernetes' security principals and will therefore move away from that concept.
