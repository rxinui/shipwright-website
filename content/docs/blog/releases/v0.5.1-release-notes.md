Shipwright Build v0.5.1 can be found on GitHub at [shipwright-io/build v0.5.1](https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/releases/tag/v0.5.1).

This release includes a breaking change to BuildRun's `status` subobject.
This removal was announced in [v0.4.0](https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/releases/tag/v0.4.0).
Clients should use the status conditions of the BuildRun object to infer object state - see the documentation for more details.

## Upgrade Instructions

0. Ensure that your processes do not rely on the `status.succeeded` or `status.reason` fields of any `BuildRun` object.
1. Install v0.5.1 using the release YAML manifest:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/releases/download/v0.5.1/release.yaml
   ```
